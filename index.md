To summarise, BAIT
$$x = y$$
- Integrates a (growing) collection of current AI-ITP approaches and benchmarks into a unified platform
- Streamlines developing and experimenting with the different components of AI-ITP architecture
- Facilitates reproducible and transparent results

  BAIT was introduced as a AAAI24 Main Track paper, where it was used to study Embedding Architectures in AI-ITP.
