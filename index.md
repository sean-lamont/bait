BAIT is a platform for accelerating research in the application of AI to Interactive Theorem-Proving (AI-ITP). 

BAIT was accepted as a AAAI24 Main Track paper, where it was used to study Embedding Architectures in AI-ITP.

To summarise, BAIT
- Integrates a (growing) collection of current AI-ITP approaches and benchmarks into a unified platform
- Streamlines developing and experimenting with the different components of AI-ITP architecture
- Facilitates reproducible and transparent results
