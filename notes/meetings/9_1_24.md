# PhD Update 9/1/23

## Update 
- AAAI 
  - Author list/order
  - Video?
  - Booking travel/registration 

- HOList integration
  - Added pretty printed expressions into live environment
  - Proof logging: Had to delve deep into the O'Caml code to modify this to return pretty printed expressions when tracing proofs
    - Reproduced original dataset (for complex and core libraries) with pretty printed expressions
    - Flyspeck is traced separately, importing another github project. Future work, could also use this to 
    include any arbitrary hol light github project
  - End to End setup now running with HOList environment and the original s-expression based tactic model
    - Restrictions within HOList environment mean that we can't just give the environment an arbitrary expression
      - Has to be of format tactic + premise
      - Could still train model to use this format based on pretty printed expressions
    - For now, runs and works without changes to proof logging, tracing/visualisation, proof search,
    parallelism etc.

- ILQL
  - Approach for finetuning language models based on RL
    - Trains Q/V models to predict the value of a state and each subsequent token
    - Regularised by original reference model
  - Doesn't require preferences, just reward signal
  - Advantage over DPO: Can utilise all data from a trace, rather than having to handcraft preferences
  - Disadvantage: Requires extra transformer model to estimate Q-values/value estimates
  - Implemented for our setting and tested training. 
    - Still need to implement beam search/sampling for inference and test it end to end 

- Running ReProver over much larger training set to get additional data
  - Hopefully enough to get a better goal model
  - Will have ground truth of good goal states for every example here 

## TODO 
- BAIT
  - Focus on documenting and tidying codebase
  - Make website 
  - HOL4?
  - Further improvements to pipeline (e.g. automatic training after an evaluation loop, automatic processing of data,
  combining proofs from multiple attempts)
   
- Integrate HOL4 with other models
- Add retriever based model
- Continue with ILQL experiments
- Continue with proof search experiments
