# PhD Update 3/10/23

## Proof Search
### Progress
- UpDown Implemented in HOL4
- No improvement in performance, not surprising given small average proof length 

- Full fringe and UpDown implemented in HOL4
## LeanDojo
### Progress
- Implemented separation of proof state and search which separates subgoals, currently testing
  - Advantages: Smaller context for each goal, training set more aligned with live tactic state, can use more complex algos such as fringe, HTPS, UpDown
- Visualisation of proof trees, giving some insight into possible improvements

## TODO
- Implement proof recording pipeline to enable training from agent interaction
