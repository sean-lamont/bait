# PhD Update 27/11/23

### Sampling
- Added Nuclueus sampling as per Christian's suggestion 
  - Generation strategy now configurable, either beam or sampling
    - Added loop to generate until k unique samples are generated, where k was the previous num_beams
      - Slowly increase temperature and top-p every iteration to flatten distribution 
    - Will be useful to ensure DPO data satisfies their assumptions more closely
  - Initially, seems like it performs worse than beam search

### HTPS
- Most of the week spent testing HTPS
  - Naive implementation of their algorithm has a few problems, 
  took quite some time to find what these were 
    - E.g. pushing all parents initially to backpropagate, without ensuring all the children are updated
  - Many tests and sanity checks, have a better understanding of the algorithm now 

### TODO 
- Test and compare HTPS and UpDown
  - Visualise proofs and the scores given from each approach
- Try get DPO stabilised for evaluation, and test performance
- Check scores from top-p
