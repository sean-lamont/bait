# PhD Update 19/9/23

## Proof Search
### Progress

- Full fringe and UpDown implemented in HOL4
- Found and fixed bug in graph representation when propagating proven goals. (
Wasn't correctly terminating when open goals from a different tactic remained)
- Performance is about the same as the original approach, from small scale experiment
- Thinking about it, most HOL4 proofs were only 1-2 steps, so it's not the best benchmark for goal selection


## LeanDojo
### Progress
- Original ReProver running locally for training and inference, with original proof search eval
    - Spent a while understanding the architecture and implementation 
        - Uses DeepSpeed Library, scalable for large experiments. 
- Started implementing separation of proof state and search which separates subgoals
  - Advantages: Smaller context for each goal, training set more aligned with live tactic state, can use more complex algos such as fringe, HTPS, UpDown

## TODO
- Continue implementing subgoal separation in LeanDojo
- Implement proof recording pipeline to enable training from agent interaction
