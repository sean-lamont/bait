# PhD Update 12/12/23

## Update 
- BAIT Accepted! 
- DPO
  - More experiments supporting sampling as worse than beam search
  - Lower beta seems worse (i.e. more regularisation closer to original model seems better)
  - Unsure whether beam samples aren't valid? 
    - Can always recompute the logprob of samples chosen with beam search using any reference model 
    - Utilities to obtain 'true' logprob of beam search samples when generated (product of token probabilities)
    - Desirable to use beam samples, as it's faster, guarantees a fixed number of unique samples and performs better 
- Goal model
  - Soft labels
    - Still gives high accuracy and precision for hard labels
    - Biases model towards more uncertainty
  - Want to add exploration epsilon and/or cumulative logprob prior to UpDown encourage exploration 

## TODO 
- Camera Ready BAIT version
  - Small updates to paper (R2 comments: references, formatting, INT discussion)
    - Extra page(s)?
- Updating BAIT system 
  - Want new environments for HOList/HOL4, so it's closer to a unified platform
    - Test these with new end-to-end setup with LeanDojo (with distributed, generative models, proof tracing/visualisation,
  search strategies)
  - Documentation 
- Include retriever model from LeanDojo
