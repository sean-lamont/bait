# PhD Update 16/1/23

## Update 
- HOL4 environment 
  - Wrote initial code for porting over to new environment
  - Still needs to be tested

- Started work on ILQL inference with beam/sampling
 
- seq2seq experiment 
  - Discovered a change in the underlying model from authors on Huggingface
  - New model is worse, but aligns with what was reported in the paper
  - Had to re-run experiments
  - Lowered learning rate, evaluated more often and added metrics



## TODO
- Get ILQL inference running, before trying end-to-end experiment with this
- Updates/polishing before AAAI
- Computational complexity of planned verification (Bercher, )
- Automatically acquiring planning models from (haslum)
