# PhD Update 16/1/23

## Update 
- AAAI24
  - Great trip, met lots of people 
  - Nothing really on theorem proving, had a fair bit of interest at the poster at least
  - Workshops/tutorials were interesting, but didn't get too much out of them (mostly 'gofai' planning)

- BAIT
  - Spent the rest of the time polishing BAIT
  - Tested/polished HOList and HOL4 environments 
  - Updated documentation for End-to-End
   
- seq2seq experiment 
  - Continued running, looks to be improving

- ILQL 
  - Inference is running, but results are not great
  - Extremely slow, most likely something wrong with the implementation
  - Will need to look into this

- Search 
  - Still working on the search problem
  - New idea based on thompson sampling, will need to implement and test
    - Will work for both HTPS and UpDown
    - Idea is to have a model learn the prior parameters, then update the posterior as the search progresses
    - Balances exploration and exploitation, and doesn't weight the prior too heavily if it's not accurate

## TODO
- Will be on leave for two weeks after this week
- Aim is to have some experiments for Search running before I leave (UpDown vs HTPS vs BestFS at least)
- Stretch goal is to have ILQL running well
