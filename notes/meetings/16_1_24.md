# PhD Update 16/1/23

## Update 
- End to End training pipeline now running
  - Evaluate over proofs -> log and process -> train -> repeat
  - Slight refactor to change how processing is done, each model now must define how to process traces
    rather than a global process function 
  - Training/processing commands are defined in the config file which are called after evaluation

- Tidied and restructured codebase
 
- Started working on website (github pages) for BAIT
  - Jekyll based, with automatic github deployment 

- Booked travel
