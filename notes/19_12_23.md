# PhD Update 19/12/23

## Update 
- Camera ready AAAI submission
- Rest of time on new HOList environment
  - Overall, the environment has more fundamental restrictions than initially expected
    - Can't use arbitrary assumptions or expressions 
    - Only a subset of tactics can be used 
  - S-Expressions need to be used in the backend
    - Significantly more verbose 
    - Human proof logs and environment default to s-expression output
      - Now updated logging and environment to return pretty printed as well, but s-expressions still used in backend

## Notes
- Update DPO pipeline to include another objective with standard SFT/seq2seq loss of positive example in pair
  - Have some parameterised weighted combination 

## TODO 
- Set up DPO and Proof Search Experiments to run over the break
- Continue integrating HOList and HOL4 into end-to-end architecture
- Documentation before open sourcing BAIT
