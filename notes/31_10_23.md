# PhD Update 24/10/23
## Update
- Implemented more abstract eval loop and integrated into BAIT
  - Based off LeanDojo Reprover code, but removed most couplings to Lean
  - Abstract search tree
    - Allows for keeping/separating subgoals
    - Tracks all information required for BestFS, HTPS, UpDown, BFS and for training data
  - Takes in abstract environment, search and tac_gen classes
    - Environment just needs to implement retrieve_premises and run_tac, with an Edge as output
  - Should allow for an easier integration with HOL4 and HOList, so we can evaluate approaches better
    - Still some work to be done for this, changing TacticZero and HOList environments as well as decoupling 
    the tactic generation and retrievers  
- Continue running experiment removing fixed tactic expansion per goal, and depth decay
- Implemented distributed evaluation in the abstract eval setup 
  - Optimises CPU and GPU usage, by maintaining 'n' number of tac/goal models for 'n' gpus, 
   and 'm' number of provers for 'm' CPUs
  - CPUs will queue their model requests and wait for their results
  - This way, GPU models are constantly serving requests 
  - Significant speedup seen so far, since we can run e.g. 32 environments at a time even with 1 or 2 GPUs 
  - Timeout needs to be changed to only base on the environment time, since model calls are blocking
- Reading
  - Looked at DPO paper, definitely seems like the best way to train the tac_gen model
  - Will still need reward for goal model, since there isn't a natural ranking 
    - Simple PPO loss with importance weights and KL term seems like the best way for this 
    - Retriever approach TBD
    - Trick could work with pointwise goal ranking 
  - Language agents for proving
    - Made some notes on the paper, if Christian wants them
## TODO
- Decide on format and process proof logs into training data for tactic and goal models
  - Want this to run every iteration over the evaluation dataset, retraining the goal and tactic models
- Add wandb and hydra configs so the eval loop is properly integrated into BAIT
- Add BestFS and BFS into eval loop 
- Start implementing HTPS
